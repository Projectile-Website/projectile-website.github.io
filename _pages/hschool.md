Deciding a career path during school days is quite a daunting task. As much as it's nice for more children to take up careers in scientific fields, it is very important to first make sure that you do love the subject. One way of knowing this is to participate in science programs conducted by various institutes. These programs are aimed at providing students with exposure to science and research, and students can use this exposure to gauge whether a career in science is their cup of tea. With that out of the way, lets look at some of the programs available to high school students in India.
